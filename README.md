# The RecogINATOR

This is honestly just a simple tool to help you manage a 'RECOGNISE' list for Lusternia.
As you're limited to only recognizing up to three people per r/l day, sometimes you need to be able to remember to recognize someone tomorrow when you get a slot back

Enter the recogINATOR! which allows you to maintain a queue of people who need recognition

## Usage

`recog` shows your queue. It is clickable on the titlebar and numbers.

`recog add <person> <reason>` to add someone to the queue.

Check out the alias `recog help` for full info on alias interaction.
